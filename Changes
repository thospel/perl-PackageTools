Revision history for Perl extension PackageTools.

1.007	2010-10-03 19:28:23 UT
	- Don't update Package.pm files inside a t directory
	- Remove trailing spaces from all non-binary files
	- Remove trailing empty lines from all non-binary files
	  (that aren't .diff or .patch files)
	- Add Carp, Errno, Exporter, File::Spec, IO::Handle, POSIX,
	  Test::Harness, Socket and URI to the known builtins
	- Remove duplicate dependecies
	- Generate provides with - instead of :: for ppm version 3
	- Fix implied dependencies on ppm version 3 to use - instead of ::
	- Add ppm3 and ppm4 targets to the Makefile.PL in release_pm
	- makeppd.pl can now also try to construct a ppm3 ppd from a ppm4 ppd
	- Add autogenerated documentation to Package.pm files
	- Added a --root option to specify the package root to makeppd.pl
	- Make cover tests work
	- ppd can have no space before final />
	- Output ppd name now comes from the package name
	- Make code slightly nicer for perlcritic
	- Generate code that is slightly nicer for perlcritic
	- Added a "critic" target that runs perl-critic
	- Fix the magic number to get microsecond rounding correct
	- Fix the self documentation of release_pm
	- Add a few basic any_to_blib tests

1.006	2010-06-16 12:12:23 UT
	- makeppd.pl is ran by the ppm target instead of the $(DISTNAME).ppd
	  target. ppm_install now depends on ppm.

1.005	2010-06-07 12:38:55 UT
	- Add support for requiring a minimum version of release_pm
	- Some support for the newer ppm format. VERSION may now be a float or
	  or 4 numbers separated by ,
	- Allow "--dependency" as an alias for "--prerequisite"
	- Add some real tests
	- Start requiring makeppd 1.014 in the generated Makefile.PLs (the one
	  with the changes in this release)
	- Added any_to_pm since it was getting more and more general use
	- If a Package.pm file does not exist yet (or is empty) but is mentioned
	  in the MANIFEST then create a generic one
	- Accept 0 digit versions on reread in release_pm
	- Accept 0 digit versions for the package in makeppd.pl
	- Scripts find libraries relative to the executable. Mostly needed to
	  make --version work
	- release_pm also works on deeper Makefile.PLs and t/*.t files
        - release_pm can now generate ANY_TO_BLIB sections
	- release_pm now recognizes a -T option in .t files
	- Use $(PERLRUN) instead of $(PERL)
	- Empty file doesn't count as binary
	- Empty file does not count as not ending in newline
	- Indent autogenerated sections

1.004	2009-10-16 11:59:10 UT
	- Ignore META.yml while versioning
	- Fixup run suggestion for .t files
	- Improve import_from and released handling
	- Add md5-versions to MANIFEST if not already there
	- Add MANIFEST.SKIP
	- Detect duplicates in MANIFEST
	- Force Package.pm version to be the release version
	- release_pm now ignores more source control keywords (Id,URL,HeadURL)
	- Source control keywords now get canonicalized differently. This means
	  that all old files that have them will count as different the first
	  time this new version is used
	- Normalize the header text in test files a bit
	- Improve error messages in makeppd.pl for the case of missing bsd tar
	  or commandline zip
	- Fix package mappings containing :: (they become - in the ppd)
	- Support BEGIN { $VERSION = "1.234" } style version lines
	- Add "ppm_install" and "ppm_uninstall" make targets
	- On windows do CRLF conversion when copying to blib
	- Add an autogenerated line to Package.pm
	- Package.pm now uses "use vars" instead of "our". This is more
	  portable to older perls
	- Bring $VERSION inside START_HISTORY. This means older Package.pm files
	  have to be edited to get rid of the $VERSION outside the substitution
	  range
	- Try to autodetect and properly handle binary files
	  (possibly a bad idea in a unicode world. Might need work)
	- Replace the "--again" option by "--next" with exactly the opposite
	  meaning. Old "--again" is now the default". Use "--next" just AFTER
	  doing a release.
	- Check minimum needed version
	- Save md5-versions.old if any changes
	- Notify the user when a release is updated
	- Fixup ppd ARCHITECTURE NAME for perl 5.10 (workaround for a perl bug)
	- Added a --binary option, default off. If this option is off the
	  architecture and OS fields are removed
	- Add support for ppm <PROVIDE>
	  (probably should get an option to turn it off too)
	- release_pm can now autogenerate the Makefile.PL postamble
	- Force the version of .pm files that use the DynaLoader or XSLoader to
	  the package version
	- Add a "cover" target to the Makefile.PL substitution
	- Only use format when switching to a new version number. This in an
	  attempt to make what gets written be the same as what was read if
	  there are no changes
	- Add a %postamble hash inside a BEGIN block. Make postamble use that.
	  This allows easy extending
	- Do our own $Version$ keyword substitution
	- Declare %postamble with use vars, making Makefile.PL more portable
	- Replace makeppd boolean option --binary with optional string option
	  --objects. Then use $(OBJECT) as argument in the release_pm template
	- Add some fsyncs
	- Add a DATE field to md5-versions and a release_time to Package.pm

1.003	2007-11-12 09:49:27 UT
	- propegate ANY changes better so the Changes will get updated
	- Make first "revision history" line in Changes optional

1.002	2007-11-09 14:05:58 UT
	- New file should also immediately get a released entry
	- Add a --map option to makeppd.pl so that the user can also add
	  conversion from module version to ppm package
	- Initial documentation for makeppd.pl

1.001	2007-10-31 12:36:18 UT
	- Fix a bug that release_pm --again sometimes did not update the
	  version of a changed file.

1.000	2007-10-29 11:14:08 UT
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-b 5.8.0 -AXn PackageTools
	- Import already existing ad hoc versions of release_pm and makeppd.pl
	- Streamline the code
	- Add support for auto-updating the date in Changes
	- Add support for auto-updating the version in README
	- makeppd.pl now supports running under a different perl version than
	  the one used to start the program
