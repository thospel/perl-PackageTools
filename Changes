Revision history for Perl extension PackageTools.

1.004	2008-01-04 18:11:20 UT
	- Ignore META.yml while versioning
	- Fixup run suggestion for .t files
	- Improve import_from and released handling
	- Add md5-versions to MANIFEST if not already there
	- Add MANIFEST.SKIP
	- Detect duplicates in MANIFEST
	- Force Package.pm version to be the release version
	- release_pm now ignores more source control keywords (Id,URL,HeadURL)
	- Source control keywords now get canonicalized differently. This means
	  that all old files that have them will count as different the first
	  time this new version is used
	- Normalize the header text in test files a bit
	- Improve error messages in makeppd.pl for the case of missing bsd tar
	  or commandline zip
	- Fix package mappings containing :: (they become - in the ppd)
	- Support BEGIN { $VERSION = "1.234" } style version lines
	- Add a "ppm_install" make target
	- On windows do CRLF conversion when copying to blib
	- Add an autogenerated line to Package.pm
	- Package.pm now uses "use vars" instead of "our". This is more
	  portable to older perls
	- Bring $VERSION inside START_HISTORY. This means older Package.pm files
	  have to be edited to get rid of the $VERSION outside the substitution
	  range
	- Try to autodetect binary files
	  (probably a bad idea in a unicode world. Needs more work)

1.003	2007-11-12 09:49:27 UT
	- propegate ANY changes better so the Changes will get updated
	- Make first "revision history" line in Changes optional

1.002	2007-11-09 14:05:58 UT
	- New file should also immediately get a released entry
	- Add a --map option to makeppd.pl so that the user can also add
	  conversion from module version to ppm package
	- Initial documentation for makeppd.pl

1.001	2007-10-31 12:36:18 UT
	- Fix a bug that release_pm --again sometimes did not update the
	  version of a changed file.

1.000	2007-10-29 11:14:08 UT
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-b 5.8.0 -AXn PackageTools
	- Import already existing ad hoc versions of release_pm and makeppd.pl
	- Streamline the code
	- Add support for auto-updating the date in Changes
	- Add support for auto-updating the version in README
	- makeppd.pl now supports running under a different perl version than
	  the one used to start the program
