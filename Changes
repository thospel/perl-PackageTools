Revision history for Perl extension PackageTools.

1.012	2021-07-15 10:41:48 UT
	- Placeholder

1.011	2021-05-24 13:42:52 UT
	- release_pm: Use timegm with years without subtracting 1900
	- release_pm: Make bin/* and t/*.t files executable
	- release_pm: Update MANIFEST.SKIP
	- release_pm: Support README.md in Makefile.PL
	- release_pm: Add more postamble sections in Makefile.PL,
                      Remove duplicate postamble sections

1.010	2020-10-13 15:40:57 UT
        - release_pm: First write new files to a temporary before updating.
	  Untested on windows
	  (will probably fail on windows due to the typical filesystem races)
	- Added downgrade version check
	- release_pm: Added a sub_release
	- Force pdf to be "binary". They often are plain text at the start so
	  perl -B thinks they are completely plain text
	- Make -h work on windows

1.009	2012-05-03 10:32:19 UT
	- makeppd.pl: find bsdtar and zip through the PATH. Internally extend
	  the PATH with "C:/Program Files/GnuWin32/bin"
	- release_pm: Put the package name in the intial Package.pm HeadURL
	- release_pm: If we don't find any_to_blib in the path just leave the
	  string as is. If you need any_to_blib, add PackageTools to the
	  BUILD_REQUIRES in Makefile.PL

1.008	2010-12-13 12:50:46 UT
	- release_pm: Fix a very minor bug where a script name was not expanded
	  in a comment in Makefile.PL
	- any_to_blib: Add a "--define" option allowing the caller to set
	  name/value pairs
	- release_pm: Bugfix: vcs directives must end on "whitspace $" instead
	  of just "$" to be recognized
	- any_to_blib: Fix some total nonsense in the documentation
	- any_to_blib: Start by writing the processing that will be done
	  so that if it fails we know on what file it failed
	- any_to_blib: Support multiple proxy files
	- release_pm: New option "--vcs_check"
	- release_pm: On windows any_to_blib doesn't have to be "executable"

1.007	2010-10-21 13:03:02 UT
	- release_pm: Don't update Package.pm files inside a t directory
	- release_pm: Remove trailing spaces from all non-binary files
	- release_pm: Remove trailing empty lines from all non-binary files
	  (that aren't .diff or .patch files)
	- makeppd.pl: Add Carp, Errno, Exporter, File::Spec, IO::Handle, POSIX,
	  Test::Harness, Socket and URI to the known builtins
	- makeppd.pl: Remove duplicate dependecies
	- makeppd.pl: Generate provides with - instead of :: for ppm version 3
	- makeppd.pl: Fix implied dependencies on ppm version 3 to use - instead
	  of ::
	- Add ppm3 and ppm4 targets to the Makefile.PL in release_pm
	- makeppd.pl can now also try to construct a ppm3 ppd from a ppm4 ppd
	- release_pm: Add autogenerated documentation to Package.pm files
	- makeppd.pl: Added a --root option to specify the package root
	- Make cover tests work
	- makeppd.pl: ppd can have no space before final />
	- makeppd.pl: Output ppd name now comes from the package name
	- Make code slightly nicer for perlcritic
	- Generate code that is slightly nicer for perlcritic
	- release_pm: Added a "critic" target that runs perl-critic
	- Fix the magic number to get microsecond rounding correct
	- release_pm: Fix the self documentation
	- Add a few basic any_to_blib tests
	- any_to_blib: Added a "--base_dir" option to
	- any_to_blib: Removed internal "--blib" option
	  (leaving the official one)

1.006	2010-06-16 12:12:23 UT
	- makeppd.pl is ran by the ppm target instead of the $(DISTNAME).ppd
	  target. ppm_install now depends on ppm.

1.005	2010-06-07 12:38:55 UT
	- release_pm: Add support for requiring a minimum version
	- makeppd.pl: Some support for the newer ppm format. VERSION may now be
	  a float or or 4 numbers separated by ,
	- makeppd.pl: Allow "--dependency" as an alias for "--prerequisite"
	- Add some real tests
	- release_pm: Start requiring makeppd 1.014 in the generated
	  Makefile.PLs (the one with the changes in this release)
	- Added any_to_blib since it was getting more and more general use
	- release_pm: If a Package.pm file does not exist yet (or is empty) but
	  is mentioned in the MANIFEST then create a generic one
	- release_pm: Accept 0 digit versions on reread
	- makeppd.pl: Accept 0 digit versions for the package
	- Scripts find libraries relative to the executable. Mostly needed to
	  make --version work
	- release_pm: also work on deeper Makefile.PLs and t/*.t files
        - release_pm: can now generate ANY_TO_BLIB sections
	- release_pm: now recognizes a -T option in .t files
	- Use $(PERLRUN) instead of $(PERL)
	- any_to_blib: Empty file doesn't count as binary
	- any_to_blib: Empty file does not count as not ending in newline
	- release_pm: Indent autogenerated sections

1.004	2009-10-16 11:59:10 UT
	- release_pm: Ignore META.yml while versioning
	- release_pm: Fixup run suggestion for .t files
	- release_pm: Improve import_from and released handling
	- release_pm: Add md5-versions to MANIFEST if not already there
	- release_pm: Add MANIFEST.SKIP
	- release_pm: Detect duplicates in MANIFEST
	- release_pm: Force Package.pm version to be the release version
	- release_pm: now ignores more source control keywords (Id,URL,HeadURL)
	- release_pm: Source control keywords now get canonicalized differently.
	  This means that all old files that have them will count as different
	  the first time this new version is used
	- Normalize the header text in test files a bit
	- makeppd.pl: Improve error messages in  for the case of missing bsd tar
	  or commandline zip
	- makeppd.pl: Fix package mappings containing :: (they become - in the
	  ppd)
	- release_pm: Support BEGIN { $VERSION = "1.234" } style version lines
	- release_pm: Add "ppm_install" and "ppm_uninstall" make targets
	- On windows do CRLF conversion when copying to blib
	- release_pm: Add an autogenerated line to Package.pm
	- release_pm: Package.pm now uses "use vars" instead of "our". This is
	  more portable to older perls
	- release_pm: Bring $VERSION inside START_HISTORY. This means older
	  Package.pm files have to be edited to get rid of the $VERSION outside
	  the substitution range
	- release_pm: Try to autodetect and properly handle binary files
	  (possibly a bad idea in an unicode world. Might need work)
	- release_pm: Replace the "--again" option by "--next" with exactly the
	  opposite meaning. Old "--again" is now the default". Use "--next" just
	  AFTER doing a release.
	- release_pm: Check minimum needed version
	- release_pm: Save md5-versions.old if any changes
	- release_pm: Notify the user when a release is updated
	- makeppd.pl: Fixup ppd ARCHITECTURE NAME for perl 5.10 (workaround for
	  a perl bug)
	- makeppd.pl: Added a --binary option, default off. If this option is
	  off the architecture and OS fields are removed
	- makeppd.pl: Add support for ppm <PROVIDE>
	  (probably should get an option to turn it off too)
	- release_pm: can now autogenerate the Makefile.PL postamble
	- release_pm: Force the version of .pm files that use the DynaLoader or
	  XSLoader to the package version
	- release_pm: Add a "cover" target to the Makefile.PL substitution
	- release_pm: Only use format when switching to a new version number.
	  This in an attempt to make what gets written be the same as what was
	  read if there are no changes
	- release_pm: Add a %postamble hash inside a BEGIN block. Make postamble
	  use that. This allows easy extending
	- release_pm: Do our own $Version$ keyword substitution
	- release_pm: Declare %postamble with use vars, making Makefile.PL more
	  portable
	- makeppd.pl: Replace  boolean option --binary with optional string
	  option --objects.
	- release_pm: Then use $(OBJECT) as argument in the ppd template
	- Add some fsyncs
	- release_pm: Add a DATE field to md5-versions and a release_time to
	  Package.pm

1.003	2007-11-12 09:49:27 UT
	- release_pm: propegate ANY changes better so the Changes will get
	  updated
	- release_pm: Make first "revision history" line in Changes optional

1.002	2007-11-09 14:05:58 UT
	- release_pm: New file should also immediately get a released entry
	- makeppd.pl: Add a --map option so that the user can also add
	  conversion from module version to ppm package
	- makeppd.pl: Initial documentation

1.001	2007-10-31 12:36:18 UT
	- release_pm: Fix a bug where --again sometimes did not update the
	  version of a changed file.

1.000	2007-10-29 11:14:08 UT
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-b 5.8.0 -AXn PackageTools
	- Import already existing ad hoc versions of release_pm and makeppd.pl
	- Streamline the code
	- release_pm: Add support for auto-updating the date in Changes
	- release_pm: Add support for auto-updating the version in README
	- makeppd.pl: now supports running under a different perl version than
	  the one used to start the program
